# React: Todo List

## Overview

This sixteen-week project will teach you how to build a basic Todo List application with React.

Each lesson is a an individual assignment, but you will work out of the same repository for the entire project. See instructions below for how to submit each week.

Grading for this project is less rigid, given the open-ended instructions ([View Grading Rubric](instructions/rubric.md)). Make sure to follow the checklist for each lesson, but how you implement each task is entirely up to you!
